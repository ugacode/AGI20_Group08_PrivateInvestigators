				<h1>Geolocation</h1>
				<p>The distinctive feature that characterizes the City Rat role is the ability for the player to walk outdoors in a geographically confined area in order to collect pieces of evidence. This is accomplished by displaying a custom map of the surrounding environment, with a virtual avatar positioned at the player's current position (detected via the device's GPS). By walking around, it is possible to get close enough to virtual objects &ndash; placed randomly on the map &ndash; to collect them and find out what evidence is hidden in them. For each one, the player will be presented a different challenge to be completed before unlocking a piece of evidence. Moving too fast in the environment will cause the player's &quot;vision&quot; to become blurry, thus making it more difficult to catch the spawned items.</p>
				<p>Main technologies used for this feature were Unity (version 2019.4.10) and the Mapbox API, alongside Unity's post-processing stack.</p>

				<h1>Augmented Reality</h1>
				<p>One of the main features associated to the Genius role is the presence of AR in the game. It enables original and entertaining interaction modalities, which keep even a home-based player involved in the progress of the investigation. The user can select a piece of evidence from the inventory, place it in the surrounding environment, scale it to the desired dimensions and inspect its surface with a virtual UV lamp in search for potential clues. Unlocking the clues hidden on the different items will help bring the investigation forward.</p>
				<p>Main technologies used for this feature were Unity (version 2019.4.10) and AR Core with AR Foundation, as the game was developed for Android platforms.</p>

				<h1>Gyroscope input and haptic feedback</h1>
				<p>With the intention of providing a fun, entertaining and unique challenge to the player taking the role of the City Rat, a minigame prototype was developed using input from the device's gyroscope and output using its vibration motors. The challenge is presented in the form of a vault lock, to be opened by turning the knob with the device until the right sequence of numbers is detected. A short vibration provides feedback on the correct combination, while short "ticking" audio clips, associated to each movement of the knob, aid the calibration of the users' own movement. Once the lock is opened, a new piece of evidence will be revealed to the player and stored in the inventory shared by all those involved in the investigation.</p>

				<h1>Gesture Recognition</h1>
				<p>We considered for a while the idea of using gestures in AR to allow the Genius to manipulate any virtual object easly and effectively. We therefore explored the use of a gesture recognition software such as Manomotion with basic interaction, but we were slowed down by two issues; incompatibility between the version of Unity we were working on and the version supported by Manomotion; lack of any form of detailed documentation on how to implement basic functionalities, both in the official website and in third-party online forums. We decided to abandon the idea, to focus on other features.</p>
				<p>Main technologies used for this feature were Unity (version 2020.1.11), Manomotion SDK (version 1.3) and AR Core with AR Foundation, as the game was developed for Android platforms.</p>

				<h1>3D modelling and animation</h1>
				<p>We have also explored 3D modelling and animation as side-branches to the project, with the aim of opening up the possibility of using our own assets instead of prefabs downloaded from the Internet. In particular, one main objective was modelling and animating a virtual avatar to be used in the virtual map for the City Rat role. The results of the exploration were arguably worse than the prefabs we were using since the start of the project, which we ended up keeping. We decided however to use our own custom model</p>
				<p>Main technologies used for this feature were Blender (version 2.90.0) and Unity (version 2019.4.10).</p>
